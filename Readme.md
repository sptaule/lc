# It is www.lucaschaplain.design website 

Nothing really interesting here, just the source code of my personal website

I wanted it to be simple but elegant, no cheese.
- TailwindCSS used for style classes
- ThreeJS for the homepage animation only
- Both vanilla and jQuery used for beauty (just a sip)
- Text glitch effect on menu with glitch.js (by danieltamkin)
